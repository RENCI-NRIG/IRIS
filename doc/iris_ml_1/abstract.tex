There are renewed interests recently in data integrity error detection and localization driven by the exponentially growing data volumes 
over large-scale networked systems. Most existing RCA (Root cause analysis) systems take an infrastructure operator's view and rely on 
dedicated and expensive monitoring capabilities to instrument and facilitate the analysis. Unfortunately, in our targeted wide area network 
environment, complete network information and monitoring capability are normally lacking. 

In this paper, we present a RCA system that leverages the end-to-end flow monitoring information 
from the application layer, augmented by limited network information. We demonstrated that root cause localization with high accuracy 
can be obtained using multi-class classification models. We specifically studied the 
impacts of different realistic combinations of features based on the available yet incomplete information from both application and 
network layers.
