In large-scale networked systems, root cause analysis (RCA) for error diagnosis 
becomes extremely challenging due to the difficulty to build precise system models.
With the evergrowing applications and services involving intensive data transfers, 
a more challenging failure mode, integrity error, has raised much research interest recently 
because it can cause severe data corruptions but the faulty infrastructural element(s) 
can stay stealth from the existing reliable protocols like TCP, encrypted transfer and RAID, etc.

In this paper, we present a RCA system to localize the root causes of ``gray or silent failures" like the integrity error through creating the mapping between the application 
level flow characteristics and the network component faults. We targeted a typical multi-administrative-domain environment where sufficient end-to-end visibility 
and monitoring information are lacked and adopted a multi-class classification machine learning (ML) approach to learn the mapping from training data sets. 

We built a high-fidelity emulation environment in a cloud testbed with a suite of software tools to automate the training data generation that includes bootstrapping the network, 
instrumenting data transfers, injecting integrity errors at chosen network elements, and collecting the training data. Through emulating a data transfer workflow system over a wide-area network, 
we show that high accuracy root cause localization can be achieved with efficient model training and inference, feature engineering, and data oversampling techniques.
