In this paper, we present a system to localize the root causes of integrity errors in large-scale networked systems. 
This particular ``gray failure mode" has raised much research interest recently 
because it can cause severe data corruptions but the faulty system element(s) 
can stay stealth from the existing reliable protocols like TCP, encrypted transfer and RAID, etc.

We targeted a typical multi-domain environment where network routing 
and monitoring information are normally lacking and thereafter adopted a multi-class classification machine learning (ML) approach. 
Different from most existing system that based on packet level monitoring and statistics,  
we developed a RCA system that learns the mapping between the application level flow characteristics and the network component failures.

We built a high-fidelity emulation environment in a cloud testbed with a suite of software tools that can 
emulate a data transfer workflow system over a wide-area network topology and inject integrity errors at chosen network elements.
We demonstrated that high accuracy root cause localization can be trained with a random forest model, feature engineering, and data oversampling techniques.
