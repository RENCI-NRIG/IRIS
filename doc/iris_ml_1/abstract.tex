For large-scale distributed applications involving intensive data transfers over a network, root cause analysis (RCA) for error diagnosis becomes extremely challenging due to the lack of network visibility and monitoring information.
One challenging failure mode is the integrity errors, a type of ?grey failures?, has raised much research interest recently because it can stay stealth from the existing reliable protocols and cause severe applications performance degradation.
In this paper, we cast the integrity error RCA problem as a multi-class classification machine learning (ML) problem. We first built an high-fidelity emulation environment in a Cloud testbed with a suite of software tools to automate the training data generation that includes bootstrapping the network, instrumenting data transfers, injecting arbitrary integrity errors, and collecting the training data. 
We then conducted extensive RCA ML model analysis with the harvested data from emulating a data transfer workflow system over a wide-area multi-domain network with many end hosts. Our main results include (1) training performance comparison of multiple supervised ML models, (2) impact quantification of mixed numerical and categorical features on the model performance, (3) handling of the inherited data imbalance in the training data set. For inference, we used network-wide aggregated data flow as the input and a Top-k accuracy metric based on class probability distribution. The results support our main hypothesis that the mapping between the application level flow statistics and the possible network component failures can be learned with high accuracy.
