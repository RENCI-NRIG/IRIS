For large-scale distributed applications involving intensive data transfers over networks, root cause analysis (RCA) for error diagnosis becomes extremely challenging due to the lack of network visibility and monitoring information.
One challenging failure mode is the integrity error, a type of ``grey failures", that has raised much research interest recently because it can stay stealth from the existing reliable protocols and cause severe application performance degradation.
In this paper, we presented a system for solving the integrity error RCA problem through a multi-class classification machine learning (ML) approach. We first built a high-fidelity emulation environment in a cloud testbed with a suite of software tools to automate the training data generation that includes bootstrapping the network, instrumenting data transfers, injecting integrity errors at chosen network elements, and collecting the training data. 
We then conducted extensive ML model training and analysis from emulating a data transfer workflow system over a wide-area network with several end hosts and network domains. Our main results include (1) training performance comparison of multiple supervised ML models, (2) impact quantification of mixed numerical and categorical features on the model performance, (3) handling of the inherited data imbalance in the training data set. For inference, we used network-wide aggregated data flows and a Top-k accuracy metric based on class probability distribution. These results support our main hypothesis that the mapping between the application level flow characteristics and the network component failures for RCA can be learned with high accuracy.
