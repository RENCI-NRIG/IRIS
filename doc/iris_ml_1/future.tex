We developed a machine learning based RCA system that combines the information and capabilities from both application and infrastructure layers. 
The impacts of different combinations of numerical and categorical data features under different realistic network and measurement assumptions are quantified in an emulation environment. 
The analysis validated that high RCA accuracy to the device level can be achieved with an efficient machine learning model even only partial network and flow level measurement information are available.

For our future work, we plan to study networks of larger scale with different topology characteristics, finer tuned ML models, and possible integration with limited network monitoring information. we will further explore the multi-granularity classification framework for large networks. While we focused on single faulty component scenario for integrity errors in this study, we plan to expand to other failure modes and performance degradation RCA systems with multiple concurrent faults. We will also study stochastic approaches that leverages the probability distribution characteristics of the network failures.
