In this paper, we studied the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) problem for integrity error diagnosis that is critical to reliably operate large-scale distributed applications. The main challenges of the incomplete network state information, low probabilistic nature of gray failures, and infeasible scalable system model have inspired much research interest recently.

In this study, we cast the problem as a multi-class classification problem and adopt the machine learning approach. We first built an emulation environment in a Cloud testbed that allows creating high-fidelity virtual systems to emulate arbitrary large-scale networks and run the real application software. We further developed a suite of software tools to automate the whole analysis workflow that includes virtual network creation, routing control plane configuration, integrity error injection, experimental data transfer and integrity check, training data collection, and ML model training and analysis.

We compared several machine learning models on data generated from an emulated network. We defined a specific preprocessing procedure to generate the data samples for the model training and a Top-$k$ accuracy metric based on class probability distribution. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach and its potential to apply the learned models to production systems.  

For our future work, we plan to experiment with larger networks with different graph characteristics to gain more insights on the accuracy of the ML models. As we have explained that end host level flow information only is not sufficient to gain very high model accuracy, we will explore efficient algorithmic approaches to find minimum monitoring capability in chosen components of the network. Another interesting extension is to distinguish the error probabilities of different types of devices in the network. We need a finer RCA model that not only pinpoints the error locations, but also the error probability estimate. We are also exploring a broader range of machine learning models including the neural network and more adequate validation methods. 

Our ultimate goal is to use the developed system and models in production systems for real-time RCA with high accuracy.
