In this study, we targeted the integrity error RCA problem for large-scale distributed application systems deployed over a wide area multi-domain network environment. We formulated this problem as a multi-class classification problem. Different from most existing systems that are based on packet level monitoring and statistics,  we developed a RCA system based on a ML model that learns the mapping between the application level flow characteristics and the network component failures. 

We built a high-fidelity controlled emulation environment in a cloud testbed to collect training data. This environment allows creating virtual systems to emulate arbitrary large-scale networks, ejecting integrity errors, and running the real application software. 
Among several multi-class classification models being evaluated, a random forest model demonstrated the best performance. We further quantified the impacts of training data features that include the flow coverage and characteristics as well as the inherited training data imbalance problem due to the differentiated failure probabilities in network and storage components. 

For our future work, we plan to study networks of larger scale with different topology characteristics, finer tuned ML models, and possible integration with limited network monitoring information. we will further explore the multi-granularity classification framework for large networks. While we focused on single faulty component scenario for integrity errors in this study, we plan to expand to other failure modes and performance degradation RCA systems with multiple concurrent faults. We will also study stochastic approaches that leverages the probability distribution characteristics of the network failures.
