We developed a machine learning based network integrity error RCA system that leverages the end-to-end flow monitoring information 
from the application layer, augmented by limited network information. The impacts of different combinations of numerical and categorical data 
features under different realistic network and measurement assumptions on the inference accuracy are quantified via an emulated network created 
in an automated high-fidelity emulation environment we built. The analysis validated that high RCA accuracy to the device level can be achieved with an efficient supervised 
learning model even when only partial network and flow level measurement information are available.

For our future work, we plan to study networks of larger scales with different topology characteristics, multiple concurrent faults, more finely tuned ML models and possible integration with limited network monitoring information.
We will further explore the multi-granularity classification framework and stochastic approaches that leverage the probability distribution characteristics of the network failures.
