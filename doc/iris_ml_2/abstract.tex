Most recent network failure diagnosis systems focused on data center networks where 
complex measurement systems can be deployed to derive routing information and ensure network coverage 
in order to achieve accurate and fast fault localization. In this paper, we target wide-area networks that 
support data-intensive distributed applications. We first present a new multi-output prediction model 
that directly maps the application level observations to localize the system component failures. 
In reality, this application-centric approach may face the missing data challenge as some input (feature) data 
to the inference models may be missing due to incomplete or lost measurements in wide area networks. 
We show that the presented prediction model naturally allows the {\it multivariate} imputation to recover the missing data. 
We evaluate multiple imputation algorithms and show that the prediction performance can be improved significantly in 
a large-scale network. As far as we know, this is the first study on the missing data issue and applying imputation techniques in network failure localization.
